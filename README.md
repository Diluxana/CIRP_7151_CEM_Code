## Machine Learning for Cybersecurity Threat Detection: Protocol-Based Predictive Modeling and Classification

1. *Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) & Data Preprocessing*
   - In this notebook, the malicious cybersecurity data is analyzed and appropriate data processing techniques are performed to prepare the data for modeling.
   - [EDA & Data Preprocessing Notebook](https://github.com/Diluxana/CIRP_7151_CEM_Code/blob/main/EDA_Data_processing.ipynb)
   - [Data Profiling Report] (https://github.com/Diluxana/CIRP_7151_CEM_Code/blob/main/cyber_report.html)
2. *Dimensionality Reduction and Model Creation*
   - Dimensionality reduction techniques, specifically Principal Component Analysis (PCA), are applied in this notebook to reduce the complexity of the data.
   - Four models, namely Catboost, LightGBM, XGBoost, and Multi-Layer Perceptron Network for Binary Classification, are implemented.
